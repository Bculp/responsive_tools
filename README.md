# simple_tools

### This project includes a simple calculator and timer. The main purpose of the project was to practice responsive design by using flexbox and taking a mobile-first approach. I refrained from using any libraries or pre-formatted styling to practice my pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

#### This project is currently deployed at: https://bculp.github.io/simple_tools/

#### Alternatively, you can download or clone the repo and access either tool by opening the appropriate index.html file in your browser.
